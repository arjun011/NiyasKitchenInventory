## 💡 What I Learned  

- Implementing **Swift Concurrency** safely with `Sendable` & actor isolation  
- Handling **Firestore schema design** (inventory, suppliers, POs, movements)  
- Setting up **CI/CD with GitHub Actions** for iOS projects  
- Managing **merge conflicts** with P4Merge and Xcode merge editor  
- Building a full app workflow from login → dashboard → inventory → orders
